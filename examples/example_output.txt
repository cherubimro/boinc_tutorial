PI Computation Results
======================
Total iterations: 1000000000
Estimated value of PI: 3.141598437284653
Error from actual PI: 0.000005783705340
Accuracy: 99.9999815912%

This is an example output from the PI computation application.
The actual results will vary slightly due to the random nature
of the Monte Carlo method.

With 1 billion iterations, you can typically expect:
- Accuracy within 0.0001 of the true value
- 4-6 decimal places of precision
- Computation time of 30-60 seconds on modern CPUs

The exact value you get will differ because:
1. Random number seeding uses /dev/urandom (cryptographically random)
2. Monte Carlo method is inherently probabilistic
3. Each run samples different random points

Cross-validation note:
In a BOINC setup, 3 different clients will compute the same work unit
and produce 3 slightly different PI values. This is EXPECTED and proves
that random seeding is working correctly.
